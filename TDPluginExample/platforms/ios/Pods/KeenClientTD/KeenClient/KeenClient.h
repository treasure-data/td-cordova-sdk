 KeenClient has class methods to return managed instances of itself and instance methods
 to collect new events and upload them through the Keen IO API.
 
 Example usage:
 
    [KeenClient sharedClientWithProjectId:@"my_project_id" 
                              andWriteKey:@"my_write_key" 
                               andReadKey:@"my_read_key"];
    NSDictionary *myEvent = [NSDictionary dictionary];
    [[KeenClient sharedClient] addEvent:myEvent toEventCollection:@"purchases"];
    [[KeenClient sharedClient] uploadWithFinishedBlock:nil];

/**
 This Objective-C property represents the Keen Global Properties dictionary for this instance of the
 KeenClient. The dictionary is used every time an event is added to an event collection.
 
 Keen Global Properties are properties which are sent with EVERY event. For example, you may wish to always
 capture static information like user ID, app version, etc.
 
 Every time an event is added to an event collection, the SDK will check to see if this property is defined.
 If it is, the SDK will copy all the properties from the global properties into the newly added event.
 
 Note that because this is just a dictionary, it's much more difficult to create DYNAMIC global properties.
 It also doesn't support per-collection properties. If either of these use cases are important to you, please use 
 the Objective-C property globalPropertiesBlock.
 
 Also note that the Keen properties defined in the globalPropertiesBlock take precendence over the properties
 defined in the globalPropertiesDictionary, and that the Keen Properties defined in each individual event take
 precedence over either of the Global Properties.
 
 Example usage:
 
    KeenClient *client = [KeenClient sharedClient];
    client.globalPropertiesDictionary = @{@"some_standard_key": @"some_standard_value"};

/**
 This Objective-C property represents the Keen Global Properties block for this instance of the KeenClient. 
 The block is invoked every time an event is added to an event collection.
 
 Keen Global Properties are properties which are sent with EVERY event. For example, you may wish to always
 capture device information like OS version, handset type, orientation, etc.
 
 The block is invoked every time an event is added to an event collection. It takes as a parameter a single
 NSString, which is the name of the event collection the event's being added to. The user is responsible
 for returning an NSDictionary which represents the global properties for this particular event collection.
 
 Note that because we use a block, you can create DYNAMIC global properties. For example, if you want to
 capture device orientation, then your block can ask the device for its current orientation and then construct
 the NSDictionary. If your global properties aren't dynamic, then just return the same NSDictionary every time.
 
 Also note that the Keen properties defined in the globalPropertiesBlock take precendence over the properties
 defined in the globalPropertiesDictionary, and that the Keen Properties defined in each individual event take
 precedence over either of the Global Properties.
 
 Example usage:
 
    KeenClient *client = [KeenClient sharedClient];
    client.globalPropertiesBlock = ^NSDictionary *(NSString *eventCollection) {
        if ([eventCollection isEqualToString:@"apples"]) {
            return @{ @"color": @"red" };
        } else if ([eventCollection isEqualToString:@"pears"]) {
            return @{ @"color": @"green" };
        } else {
            return nil;
        }
    };
